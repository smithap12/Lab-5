Proportional Symbol Mapping with Leaflet

This is a graduated circle map displaying the estimated population of each state within the US in 2019. Each state has a semi-transparent circle above it that is scaled to reflect that state's population. Different zoom levels are supported on this map with the graduated circles scaling along with that zoom. Zooming in makes it easier to view circles that are close together or overlapping. Users can hover over states on the map in order to change the color of the graduated circle from orange to blue. This is to help distinguish certain targeted states. This map can be used to compare relative population sizes between states. Population data for this map comes from the United States Census Bureau. The map tiles come from Stamen Design.
